# Origins: Planeswalker Reborn

A race of space-time manipulators who escaped the Void, reborn with new powers and a home dimension built for traversal and duels.

## Core Abilities
- **Planewalk**: Main key while sneaking. Place/remove a tether that sends you to the Void when you move a set distance away, and returns you safely when possible.
- **Phaseshift**: Main key while not sneaking. Become intangible to entities (and vice-versa) while a resource bar drains and recharges.
- **Dimensional Rift**: (3s CD) Secondary key while not sneaking. Your next attack on a block makes nearby blocks intangible.
- **Void Duel**: (4s CD) Secondary key while sneaking, then punch an entity to drag you both into the Void for ~10s before returning to your original positions.

## Mobility
- **Spatial Stride**: (4s CD) Brief creative-style hover (~0.35s) with Speed II and fall-distance reset.

## Vision
- **Clairvoyance**: Highlights sneaking/invisible entities.

## Survival and Tradeoffs
- **Soulfood**: Food gives no nutrition; XP orbs feed hunger (and saturation). Bottles o' Enchanting consume XP first, then hunger if you're dry.
- **Void Veins**: Healing is halved in the Overworld; normal in the Void.
- **Insomniac**: Sleeping doesn't prevent phantoms and wipes 16 hunger.
- **Overspecialization**: Cannot use shields, chorus fruit, or ender pearls.
- **Corrupted Blood**: Immune to most vanilla medicine (milk doesn't clear effects).

## Notes
- Void has 100x coordinate scaling for long-distance travel.
- Phaseshift drains faster while sprinting or using items.
